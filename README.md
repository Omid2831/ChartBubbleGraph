This Python project generates a **bubble chart** to visualize the number of talks conducted in different countries over a range of years (2008â€“2024). Each bubble represents the **number of talks** for a specific country in a specific year, with bubble sizes and colors that can be customized.

## Features

- **Dynamic Bubble Chart**: Visualizes the number of talks per country and year.
- **Customizable Design**: Adjust colors, bubble sizes, and the dataset easily.
- **Interactive Demo**: Modify the parameters to see the changes in real-time.
- **High Contrast**: Includes a variety of visually distinct colors for better readability.
