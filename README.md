#ChartBubbleGraph 
---
This project demonstrates how to create dynamic bubble plots using Matplotlib in Python.
The size of each bubble is scaled based on its associated value, providing a clear visual representation of data magnitude.
Annotations are added to label the bubbles without arrows for a clean, minimalist look.
Perfect for visualizing trends and comparisons in a visually engaging way!
