## Bubble Chart Application 📊
---
This is a Python-based implementation of a Bubble Chart visualization. It uses `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `numpy` to generate a bubble chart based on the number of talks by country and year.

## Features

- **Dynamic Bubble Chart**: Visualizes the number of talks per country and year.


## Demo

In this demo, the chart shows example data with randomly assigned years, countries, and talk counts.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following software and packages installed:

### 1. **Python** (>= 3.7)

To install Python, download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you're unsure whether you already have Python installed, you can check by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```
2. Git 
You'll also need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed to clone the repository. You can verify if Git is installed by running:
```bash
git --version
```

3. Required Python packages:
   - `matplotlib`
   - `numpy`
   - `pandas`

Install these packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
```
Alternatively, you can install all dependencies at once using the `requirements.txt` file (if it's included in the repository):
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The `requirements.txt` file contains the following lines:
```
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
```

## Running the Script

1. Open Terminal:
On Windows, open the terminal by searching for CMD or PowerShell in the Start menu.

2. Clone the repository:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Omid2831/ChartBubbleGraph.git
```
3. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash 
cd ChartBubbleGraph
```
4. Run the Python script to generate the bubble chart:
```bash 
python bubblechart.py
```

## Alternative Way to Run the Application:

🚀 download the file and open it:
```
bubblechart.exe
```
Enjoy! 🎉
